# Central Park Squirrel Census Project (Demo)

## Overview

The Central Park Squirrel Census project (Demo) is a demonstration project showcasing my proficiency in working with Python and the Pandas library for data analysis. This project focuses on analyzing a mock dataset simulating the squirrel population in Central Park, New York City.

## Project Description

Central Park in New York City is home to a diverse population of squirrels. The Central Park Squirrel Census project (Demo) aims to showcase my ability to process and analyze data using Pandas. While this project does not use real-world data, it demonstrates how one could analyze squirrel population data by processing attributes such as color, age, location, and activities using Pandas.

## Usage

This project is intended for demonstration purposes only and is not meant for practical use. It serves as a sample project to showcase my skills in Pandas and data analysis. The actual squirrel census data is not included, and the project is not configured for real data analysis.

## Data

The project does not include real squirrel census data. Instead, it utilizes mock data to demonstrate Pandas data processing and analysis capabilities.

## Analysis

The analysis performed in this project includes basic data statistics, visualizations, distribution analysis, and activity analysis using mock data. It does not provide insights into actual squirrel populations in Central Park.

## Contributing

This project is not intended for collaborative contributions or practical use. It serves as a personal demonstration of Pandas skills.

## License

This demonstration project does not require a specific license, as it is not intended for distribution or use by others. It is for personal demonstration purposes only.
